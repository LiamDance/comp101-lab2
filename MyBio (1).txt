I'm Liam, and my life revolves around three main passions: cars, painting, and boxing. I love everything about automobiles\'97from classic muscle cars to modern sports cars, and I'm not afraid to get under the hood when needed. When I'm not around cars, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting. Boxing keeps me physically and mentally sharp, teaching me discipline and pushing me to challenge myself. These three interests keep me busy and reflect different sides of who I am\'97my love for machines, my artistic side, and my drive to stay strong.
