Lab 2 Questions:

You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:

• Which device acts as the client?
Bob’s device acts as the client,when Bob clicks the GitHub repository link in his web browser, his computer (or phone) becomes the client.

• Which device acts as the server?
GitHub servers are the server,The GitHub website is hosted on remote servers, which store the repository’s data (code, files, and metadata).


• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content?
The browser sends a request to the server,Bob’s browser interprets the URL of the repository and sends an HTTP request over the internet to the GitHub server.

• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob?
When Bob clicks the GitHub link, his browser (the client) sends an HTTP request to the GitHub server, which stores the repository. The server processes the request, packages the repository data into an HTTP response, and sends it back over the internet in packets. Bob’s browser receives the response, reassembles the data, and renders the repository page for him to view and interact with.
